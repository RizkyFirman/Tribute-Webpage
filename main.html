        <h1 id="hpar">Peter Osgood was the star among stars of the glamorous Chelsea FC side of the 1960s and 1970s.</h1>
        <p>He joined as a junior and made his debut in a League Cup tie against Workington at the age of 17. Inevitably, he stole the headlines scoring twice. Over the next two years Ossie established himself in the first team until a broken leg interrupted his career. <br>
            <br>He missed almost a year but when he returned he was, if anything, an even better player. He retained the effortless grace and sublime skills he had always possessed, but now he had added a toughness and physical presence to his game. He could score every type of goal from tap ins to long-range shots, with either feet or with his head. <br><br>
            For ten seasons Ossie was an automatic choice in the team. He famously scored in every round of the FA Cup in 1970, the last player to achieve this feat, including the vital equaliser in the Final replay. He also scored in the two cup finals over the next two seasons.
            <br><br>
            Sadly, Ossie fell out with the management as the team declined and he was sold to Southampton in March 1974 to the dismay of supporters. He did return to the Bridge for the 1978/79 season but it was an unhappy spell as we were relegated. Ossie was a shadow of the player we had once known although his two goals during that spell took his Chelsea total to 150, the joint fourth highest individual tally in our history.
            <br><br>Tragically, Peter Osgood suffered a heart attack and died in March 2006 at the age of just 59. A statue of him stands outside the West Stand.
